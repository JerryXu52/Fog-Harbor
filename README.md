# Unity 2D Prototype (Movement + Parallax Camera + Interaction UI)

A small Unity 2D prototype featuring:
- Player movement with jump + double jump
- Camera follow on X axis with simple parallax backgrounds
- Trigger-based interaction prompt that opens a dialogue UI with a key press

## Features

### Player
- Left/right movement using `Horizontal` axis
- Jump + double jump using `Jump`
- Ground check using `Physics2D.OverlapCircle`
- Sprite flip based on velocity
- Animator parameters:
  - `moveSpeed` (float)
  - `isGrounded` (bool)

### Camera
- Follows the player on X axis (keeps camera Y/Z)
- Parallax layers:
  - `farBackground` follows more strongly
  - `middleBackground` moves at half speed (0.5x) for depth

### Interaction
- Enter trigger: shows a prompt button object
- Exit trigger: hides the prompt
- While prompt is visible: press `R` to open the `talkUI`

## Controls

- Move: `A/D` or `Left/Right Arrow` (Unity Input: `Horizontal`)
- Jump / Double Jump: `Space` (Unity Input: `Jump`)
- Interact: `R` (opens dialogue UI when inside trigger)

> Note: This uses Unity’s classic Input Manager mappings (`Horizontal`, `Jump`). If you are using the new Input System, you will need to adapt input handling.

## Setup

### 1) PlayerController.cs
Attach `PlayerController` to your Player GameObject.

**Required components on the Player:**
- `Rigidbody2D`
- `Animator`
- `SpriteRenderer`

**Inspector fields to assign:**
- `Move Speed` (float)
- `The RB` (Rigidbody2D reference)
- `Jump Force` (float)
- `Ground Check Point` (Transform at player feet)
- `What Is Ground` (LayerMask for ground layers)

**Ground check tip:**
- Create an empty child object under the player, place it near the feet, and assign it to `groundCheckPoint`.
- Put your ground colliders on a dedicated Ground layer and include it in `whatIsGround`.

### 2) CameraController.cs
Attach `CameraController` to your Main Camera.

**Inspector fields to assign:**
- `Target` (Player transform)
- `Far Background` (Transform of far layer)
- `Middle Background` (Transform of middle layer)

**Parallax tuning:**
- Middle layer uses `0.5x` movement. Change the multiplier if you want stronger or weaker depth.

### 3) TalkButton.cs
Attach `TalkButton` to an NPC or trigger zone object.

**Required on the trigger object:**
- `Collider2D` with **Is Trigger** enabled

**Inspector fields to assign:**
- `Button` (a UI or world-space prompt object like “Press R”)
- `Talk UI` (the dialogue panel GameObject)

**Behavior:**
- When the player enters the trigger, `Button` becomes visible.
- When `Button` is visible and you press `R`, `talkUI` becomes active.
